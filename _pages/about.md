Yue Su is a Postdoctoral researcher at [CERMICS](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/) in [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech](https://ecoledesponts.fr/), collaborate with [Axel Parmentier](http://cermics.enpc.fr/~parmenta/home.html) and [Antoine Desir](https://www.insead.edu/faculty/antoine-desir). We aim to develop hybrid pipelines between *Machine Learning (ML)* and *Combinatorial Optimization* to predict fast and high quality solutions for complicated OR problems. Before, I obtained my PhD degree on *OR* at [CentraleSup√©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), supervised by [Jakob Puchinger](https://www.jakobpuchinger.com/) and [Nicolas Dupin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dupinnicolas/?originalSubdomain=fr) (thesis: [Heuristic and Exact Algorithms for Solving the Electric Autonomous Dial-A-Ride Problem](https://www.theses.fr/s253815)). My research interests include OR optimization algorithms, DARP, multi-objective optimization, machine learning, and revenue management.
