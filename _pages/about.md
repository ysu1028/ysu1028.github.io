I am a Postdoctoral researcher at [CERMICS](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/) in [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech](https://ecoledesponts.fr/), collaborate with Dr. Axel Parmentier and Dr. Antoine Desir. Developing hybrid pipelines between Machine Learning (ML) and Combinatorial Optimization to predict fast and high quality solutions for complicated OR problems. Before, I acheieved PhD degree at [CentraleSup√©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) on OR (thesis: Heuristic and Exact Algorithms for Solving the Electric Autonomous Dial-A-Ride Problem). My research interests include OR optimization algorithms, DARP, multi-objective optimization, machine learning, and revenue management.
