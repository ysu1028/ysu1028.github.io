I am an Associate Professor at Universit√© de Lille and [Inria INOCS team](https://team.inria.fr/inocs/). My research interests include:
1. building hybrid pipelines between *Machine Learning (ML)* and *Combinatorial Optimization* to predict fast and high-quality solutions for complicated OR problems
2. multi-objective optimization on hard mixed integer problem.

Other research interests include OR optimization algorithms (e.g., warehouse optimization), DARP, revenue management, and stochastic optimization.
